# Project 3, 30 days of javascript Asabeneh Yetayeh.

## Description:

The challenge has been to design a page that looks similar as the page in the folder ["Sample"](./sample), using only Javascript (with DOM manipulation) and HTML. 

No CSS is allowed because the lesson is about DOM manipulation.

The entire challenge was made by modifying as little as possible the initial state of the files "index.html" (just adding script some scripts and font awesome library) and the data file "challenges_info.js". 

The file "addMagic.js" is a file that has been reused from the last challenge of day 21.

## Note:

The javascript code is not really organized and can contain some repetition, the objective was to do the challenge, not to write the cleanest code. Anyways, variable names and code styling is there, but the code could be refactored by using some functions and variables to avoid repetition.
